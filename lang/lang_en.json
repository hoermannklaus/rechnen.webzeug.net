The sourrounding conditions for the predefined worksheets contained in the startpage where already set, in order to <strong>create meaningfull worksheets for elementary school pupils</strong>. <br>There is a Generator planned for the future, by which the user may choose the desired arithmetic operations as well as the according conditions."

While writing down some additions and subtractions, I came about the idea of programming a website, which uses a random generator to create these calculations. <strong>So that I would have less work to do ;-)</strong> "
